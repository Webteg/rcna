### Visualization To-Do list
> Understanding past and present situations quickly, as well as the trends and events that have produced current conditions

* [DONE] Select a node and track its position in the network from 2006 to 2013
* * Show changes of its neighbors: 1) green as added, 2) red as removed;
* * Show connections between its neighbors
* [DONE] Show network metrics when hover over a node
* [DONE] The ability to zoom into the node of interest;
* [DONE] Give the user a timeline slider, so they can track the node from 2006 to 2013
* [DONE] Show global network metrics for each graph on the side
* Color code the nodes (make it customizable)
* Show centrality leaders
* Be able to track centrality leaders through time 
* [DONE] Show local clustering coefficient of each node on node info
* Provide help text for understanding these network characteristics
* Show node's roles on different grant


> Identifying possible alternative futures and their warning signs

* Give the user ability to 1) ** add/remove node **; 2) add/remove or change the weight of an edge, in a baseline graph. The system will then run the link prediction model based on the manipulated graph and do a diff between the one without manipulation with the one that has.
